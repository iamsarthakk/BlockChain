TASK 1:
In this after reading the slides I got to know that I have to check three conditions.
The conditions involves to find hash of various variable and to find how to compute the hashes
I consulted from cryptotest.cpp and txn_t::txn_t() function in transaction.cpp.
To check digital signature I consulted slide number 30 to find how to validate
digital signature using verify() function of pub_key.
After running the test cases with helper.o I was able to pass all the test cases.
Thus I was able to implement first part of the assignment

TASK 2:
I did exacly as directed in the slides provided in the assignment and removed the previously written function.
Then I follow the instructions given in slides line by line which were easy to follow after completing first
part of assignment.
On running test1.sh I passed all three test cases
On running test2.sh I passed the test all three test cases for t4 and t5 but for t6 I was not able to verify it
because it was taking too much time on my system.
Thus I was able to implement second part of assignment.
