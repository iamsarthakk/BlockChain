Ans1: If wallet checks tx.origin instead of msg.sender for authorization then it would gets the original
      address that kicked of the transaction, which is still owner address. The attack wallet can instantly
      drain all funds after making us send some ether to him.

Ans2: ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the Interface between two program modules. It basically how we
      call functions in a contract and get data back.
      In Etherium it is needed to encode Solidity contract calls for EVM and to read data out of
      transactions.

Ans4: assert(false) compiles to 0xfe, which is an invalid opcode, using up all remaining gas, and reverting all changes while 
      require(false) compiles to 0xfd which is the REVERT opcode, meaning it will refund the remaining gas.

Ans5: A checksummed address serves as a bit of a guarantee. If the software supports testing the checksum, 
      it can tell you if you entered an invalid address (AKA., the checksum didn't match the address)
